## Overview

A blob of tips, tricks, observations, and techniques I have picked up while learning how to plan, and communicate those plas.

### Tips and Tricks
Check if your graph is Planar Embeddable:
```
E = edges
V = vertices
 
planar_embedable = E <= 3V-6 
```

### Observations

An ideal schematic must be a planar embeddedable graph.
An ideal schematic must have only has straight edges.
An ideal schematic must be a visually literal representation of its information.
circut angles must be uniform.
edge labels should the top-left of an edge.
vertices lightly-prefer to be uniformly denser than sparse. 
Every time you put a kink in an edge, you are adding extra information that does not add to the functional .
